<h4 align="center">This DLC behaved very badly towards me, so these sources are here.</h4>
<h4 align="center">I have not restored the mappings due to the fact that I do not want to waste time on this garbage.</h4>
<h4 align="center">If you have restored the mappings and want to add them to this repository, you can write to me using the contacts from my profile.</h4>
